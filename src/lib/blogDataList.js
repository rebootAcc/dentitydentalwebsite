<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Proper brushing technique ensures proper utilization of the tooth brush and toothpaste. Through the TV, ads have you believe that the toothpaste just needs to be applied and it does the job itself. Brush in a vertical (up and down) motion and not horizontally (the popular belief). Ask your dentist.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Try and give up deleterious habits like smoking, pan supari, gutkha. Restrict your intake of colas and carbonated beverages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Visit your dentist every six months.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Switch over to a new tooth paste after every 3 months.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beliefs-unravelling the truth&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The eye is never affected by any type of treatment done on you teeth including extractions. On the contrary dental infection can be a source of microbes initiating an eye Infection.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dental cavities are the consequences of bacterial colonization on your teeth. The acid produced in the bacterial colony is of sufficiently high strength to bore holes. Such a disease is known in scientific terms as Cales. Thus a cavity be known as a carious cavity.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Scaling never leads to teeth getting loose or weakned. The bacterial colony as described above persists for days if brushing technique is improper. It absorbs salts from saliva and hardens to be calculus also known as tartar or stone. Scaling every six months prevents calculus build up and keeps gums and teeth healthy.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every teeth has its own colour or shade as we call it. The shade varies between individuals. Hardly anybody have teeth as white as pearls and snow. It would look totally unnatural. Trying to achieve this means through dental treatment in unsolicited.</span></li>

    blogDescription: `<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beliefs are born of knowledge. But half truths and incorrect information about dental problems and their scientific treatment protocol has led us to believe that dental treatment is uncannily expensive.

    blogDescription: `<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The carious cavity - there are innumerable microorganisms that reside in our mouth. They are Invisible to the naked eye, but their reproductive rate is phenomenal producing colonies upon colonies of microbes. Small particles of food lodge between and within teeth when we eat. These food particles are used up as nutrition by the microbes living in the colonies which corrodes the tooth enamel (the hard outer covering), giving rise to cavities. Cavities are termed scientifically as "caries". A tooth is like a hollow cylinder consisting of nerves and veins collectively known as pulp enclosed within the hard enamel and dentin. The cavity formed in enamel eventually spreads deep through dentin to reach the pulp. A severe pain ensues with bacterial invasion of the pulp. Consequently there is an infection leading to pus formation and collection within the tooth. This phenomena is known as abcess formation. As long as the depth of the carious cavity is limited to hard tissue like dentin. The disease process can be stopped and damaged tooth structure restored by a process called "filling". Thus the tooth is salvaged. Infection of the soft pulp in deep cavities leads to severe pain making fillings ineffective. The only options available are either extraction (removal of tooth) or an RCT to save the tooth in a painless state.</span></p>

    blogDescription: `<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first among the 20 baby teeth to come out (erupt) are the front teeth (incisors) at the age of six months. The last of the milk teeth erupts at 2 yrs of age. At the age of six years The first of the adult teeth (permanent teeth) erupts through the gum behind the last of the milk tooth from the four corners of the mouth. It's important that these permanent teeth should not be confused with milk teeth. Neglecting their care would lead in untimely loss and an irreparable damage to the setting and arrangement of other subsequently erupting teeth. At the same time of about six years of age a child looses his/her front milk teeth to be replaced by permanent ones. Gradually by the age of 12 years 20 of the milk teeth are shed and permanent ones take their place. So now we have a total of 24 teeth. Other than these more teeth erupt in the mouth right behind the last tooth in all four corners taking the count to 28 The last teeth to erupt are the wisdom teeth fails to erupt or erupts only partially giving rise to pain with or without infection. A surgical extraction is the only way of relief from such a situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can teeth cause cancer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sharp or broken teeth when retained in mouth for long can be a source of constant injury to the very soft tissues of tongues and cheek and can definitely lead to a cancerous growth. It may thus be deemed mandatory to have any such teeth treated at the earliest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do's and Don'ts &gt;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never take medicines without consulting your dentist and of your own accord</span></li>
